If you asked any developer five years ago how to get into tech, you’d get a clean, repeatable answer:

Pick a niche.  
Buy a course (or live on YouTube and freeCodeCamp).  
Build some projects.  
Apply for jobs.

It wasn’t perfect, but it worked often enough to feel like a formula.

That formula is now mostly broken.

Ask that same question today and every answer sounds different, except for one recurring character that now lives in all of them:

**"AI"**

And AI didn’t just “change how we code.”  
It changed what being “junior” even means.

## The first uncomfortable truth

The entry-level ladder is partially gone.

Not “harder.”  
Not “more competitive.”  
Gone.

A lot of the small, boring, repetitive tasks that used to train junior developers are now eaten by AI tools. The stuff you would have cut your teeth on — scaffolding, CRUD boilerplate, tests, documentation, refactors — those are now _autocomplete problems_.

So companies quietly raised the bar without announcing it.

They still hire “junior developers.”  
They just expect them to think like mid-level engineers.

This is the first shock most people run into.

## Courses are not leverage anymore

In 2019, finishing a React course meant something.  
In 2026, it means you can follow instructions.

That’s not a skill. That’s literacy.

Everyone now has access to the same tutorials, the same prompts, the same boilerplate, and the same AI copilots. So the question employers are actually asking is no longer:

“Can you build this?”

It’s:

“Can you understand what this _should become_ when the requirements change, the data breaks, and the user does something weird?”

Courses teach syntax.  
They don’t teach judgment.

## Your real competition is not other juniors

Your real competition is:

- AI that writes decent code instantly
- Mid-level developers who can now ship twice as fast
- Seniors who use AI as an amplifier instead of a crutch

You are not being compared to “people who are also learning.”

You are being compared to _output_.

That changes the game completely.

## Picking a branch of tech now actually matters

Few years ago, “learn web dev” was enough and almost everyone could get a job after learning it.

Now, “web dev” is a continent.

And some parts of that continent are overcrowded, automated, and brutally competitive, while others are quietly starving for people who can think. In my opinion, there are quite a lot of "web devs", and this is largely due to the impact of AI making it easy to quickly spin up a website something a dev in 2020 would take days to complete can now be done in less than an hour.

High-pressure, high-demand branches right now tend to sit at intersections:

- Backend + data
- Frontend + product thinking
- DevOps + security
- AI tooling + real business problems
- Systems + performance + reliability

The closer your skills are to “glue that holds complex systems together,” the safer you are.  
The closer you are to “CRUD app generator,” the shakier your ground.

## The real hurdle nobody tells you about

The hardest part of entering tech in 2026 is not learning to code.

It’s learning to **think in systems.**

Understanding tradeoffs.  
Reading broken code without panicking.  
Debugging human and AI mistakes.  
Designing for failure.  
Explaining technical decisions to non-technical people.

These are the skills AI can’t automate well — and they are the skills that actually get you hired now.

## What actually works now

The new path looks less pretty, but it’s real:

- Learn the fundamentals deeply (not quickly).
- Build fewer projects — but make them messy, real, and painful.
- Break your own software and fix it.
- Write documentation like someone else has to maintain it.
- Learn to explain your decisions in plain English.
- Use AI — but don’t let it think for you.

Your portfolio and projects shouldn't look stock, they should actually display your skillset, what makes you unique and not just boilerplate projects.

## The quiet truth

2026 is still a good time to become a developer.

But it is no longer a good time to become a _surface-level_ developer.

The floor has risen.  
The ladder has changed shape.  
And the people who adapt are the ones who stop asking “what should I learn” and start asking:

“What problems can I actually solve?”

That’s where real leverage lives.
