# Where it begins!

This is the first post on my blog. I'm excited to share my journey and thoughts with you directly using this medium.

This blog post (and all other posts) was created using markdown. <br>
A bit lazy, yes, but it works! 🙃

Don't believe me? Check out the [source code](https://github.com/Kvnq-Poza/pozaportfolio) on GitHub.

If you need a breakdown on how I was able to achieve this, just hit me up on the [contact page](/contact) and I'll be happy to explain (maybe using a blog post).

## Purpose of this blog

I've always wanted to have a space to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. So, this is my very own corner on the internet to do just that.

I'll try to put out at least three posts per week but I can't promise anything (at least for now). I've been off writing for sometime and I'm learning to get right back into it.

So, here are some of the things I intend to write about:

- **Projects**: I'll be writing about projects I'm working on, challenges faced, bugs encountered, and solutions implemented.
- **Tips & Tricks**: I think the best way to get a better understanding of any concept is to be able to explain it to someone else in the simplest way possible. So, I'll be sharing tips and tricks for building scalable, performant applications.
- **Thoughts**: Maybe I'll write a bit on the chaos that sometimes goes on in my head while working and during my other activities.

If you'd like to know a bit about me, kindly check out the [about page](/about). Not enough for you? No problem, hit me up on the [contact page](/contact).
